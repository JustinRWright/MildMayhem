Mild Mayhem is a web based online multiplayer game. Taking inspiration from the Mana Series, and old Zelda games, this game incorporates old top down 2D adventure game battle mechanics and turns them into something new and fun. 

I used Phaser 3 for the game component, and React to develop a fun and interactive menu.

The backend is built with NodeJS, and Express. It is hosted on Heroku.

This game is fun for anyone who likes fast paced competitive fighting games that require mastery, strategy, player reads, and quick thinking. I hope that nostalgia for the old adventure games with new mechanics brings something fun to the table for everyone.

## Story and Journey

My journey towards this project began when I was young and had built small Scratch(MIT's educational block code platform) based video games with my friends in Middle School. At that time, I had built a game that I wanted to exist that did not, something that mixed old school Zelda mechanics with an RPG type leveling system, faster paced physics based combat, and a serious amount of flashiness. I have recreated a mutated and improved version of this vision using the skills learned from both electrical engineering school and from teaching myself full stack software engineering at FreeCodeCamp.
