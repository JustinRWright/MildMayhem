# Mild Mayhem

Mild Mayhem is a web based online multiplayer game. Taking inspiration from games such as Trials of Mana(The Mana Series), and Legend of Zelda, this game incorporates old top down 2D adventure game battle mechanics and turns them into something new and fun. 

It includes a token authentication system which allows the user to have their own account and save their own data.

Once authenticated users are logged in, they will be connnected via a multiplayer matchmaking server system and a real time socket.io connection will established.

The backend is built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It is hosted on Heroku.
You can read more on how I developed the backend in the linked repo below. 

I used Phaser 3 for the game component, and React to develop a fun and interactive UI. 

This game is fun for anyone who likes fast paced competitive fighting games that require mastery, strategy, player reads, and quick thinking. I hope that nostalgia for the old adventure games with new mechanics brings something fun to the table for everyone.

## Story and Journey

My journey towards this project began when I was young and had built small Scratch(MIT's educational block code platform) based video games with my friends in Middle School. At that time, I had built a game that I wanted to exist that did not, something that mixed old school Zelda mechanics with an RPG type leveling system, faster paced physics based combat, and a serious amount of flashiness. I have recreated a mutated and improved version of this vision using the skills learned from both Electrical Engineering School and from teaching myself full stack software engineering at FreeCodeCamp. Due to limited resources and time constraints, I have ____________, and instead went for the MVP which is being able to generate _____. I learned that compartmentalizing problems into small approachable solutions while maintaining a structured and goal oriented approach is the best way to succeed as a developer. 

### SCRUM

I had seen other projects from developers which make use of SCRUM methodogies, and adapted that idea to the development of this game in order to track my progress.

1. As a player, I want to be able to log in to my account in order to retrieve my account information and character save.

2. As a player, I want to be able to find a match with another player online.

3. As a player, I want to see who I could play against.

3. As a player, I want to be able to play a local match of the game on my computer with someone else.

4. As a player, I want to have reconfigurable controls.

5. As a player, I want to be able to move around the screen.

6. As a player, I want to be able to swing my sword.

7. As a player, I want to be able to fire a magic blast.

8. As a player, I want to be able to deflect a magic blast with my sword.

9. As a player, I want to be able to dodge an enemy attack seamlessly.
