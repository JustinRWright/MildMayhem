# Mild Mayhem

Mild Mayhem is a web based online multiplayer game. Taking inspiration from games such as Trials of Mana(The Mana Series), and Legend of Zelda, this game incorporates old top down 2D adventure game battle mechanics and turns them into something new and fun. 

It includes a token authentication system which allows the user to have their own account and save their own data.

Once authenticated users are logged in, they will be connnected via a multiplayer matchmaking server system and a real time socket.io connection will established.

The backend is built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It is hosted on Heroku.

I used Phaser 3 for the game component, and React to develop a fun and interactive UI. 

This game is fun for anyone who likes fast paced competitive fighting games that require mastery, strategy, player reads, and quick thinking. I hope that nostalgia for the old adventure games with new mechanics brings something fun to the table for everyone.

## Story and Journey

My journey towards this project began when I was young and had built small Scratch(MIT's educational block code platform) based video games with my friends in Middle School. At that time, I had built a game that I wanted to exist that did not, something that mixed old school Zelda mechanics with an RPG type leveling system, faster paced physics based combat, and a serious amount of flashiness. I have recreated a mutated and improved version of this vision using the skills learned from both Electrical Engineering School and from teaching myself full stack software engineering at FreeCodeCamp.
